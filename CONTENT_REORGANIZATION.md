## Files Moved and Organized

### Models (`content/models/`)
- **base.py**: `BaseContentModel` abstract class with common fields
- **news.py**: `News` model inheriting from `BaseContentModel`
- **education.py**: `Education` model inheriting from `BaseContentModel`
- **event.py**: `Event` model inheriting from `BaseContentModel`
- **__init__.py**: Exports all models

### Admin (`content/admin/`)
- **base.py**: `BaseContentAdmin` with common admin configuration
- **news.py**: `NewsAdmin` inheriting from `BaseContentAdmin`
- **education.py**: `EducationAdmin` inheriting from `BaseContentAdmin`
- **event.py**: `EventAdmin` inheriting from `BaseContentAdmin`
- **__init__.py**: Exports all admin classes

### Views (`content/views/`)
- **base.py**: `BaseContentListView` and `BaseContentDetailView` classes
- **news.py**: `NewsListView` and `NewsDetailView`
- **education.py**: `EducationListView` and `EducationDetailView`
- **event.py**: `EventListView` and `EventDetailView`
- **__init__.py**: Exports all view classes

### Tests (`content/tests/`)
- **test_models.py**: All model tests (17 tests)
- **test_api.py**: All API endpoint tests (17 tests)
- **__init__.py**: Exports all test classes

## Removed Files

The following old files were successfully removed after moving their content:
- `content/models.py` → moved to `content/models/` folder
- `content/admin.py` → moved to `content/admin/` folder
- `content/views.py` → moved to `content/views/` folder
- `content/tests.py` → moved to `content/tests/` folder

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. **Better Organization**
- Following the same pattern as the festival app
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier to navigate and maintain

### 2. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new content types
- Base classes provide common functionality
- Modular structure supports growth

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused files
- Clear inheritance patterns
- Consistent naming conventions

### 4. **Code Reusability**
- Base classes reduce code duplication
- Common patterns across all content types
- Easy to extend functionality

## Test Results

✅ **All 107 tests passing**
- 34 content app tests
- 73 other app tests (festival, account, province, monitoring)

## API Endpoints Still Working

All API endpoints remain functional:
- `GET /content/news/` - News list with pagination
- `GET /content/news/{id}/` - News detail
- `GET /content/education/` - Education list with pagination
- `GET /content/education/{id}/` - Education detail
- `GET /content/events/` - Events list with pagination
- `GET /content/events/{id}/` - Events detail

## Import Structure

All imports continue to work due to proper `__init__.py` files:

```python
# Still works as before
from content.models import News, Education, Event
from content.admin import NewsAdmin, EducationAdmin, EventAdmin
from content.views import NewsListView, EducationListView, EventListView
```

## Conclusion

The content app has been successfully reorganized to match the festival app structure while maintaining full functionality. The codebase is now more organized, maintainable, and follows consistent patterns across the project.
